# Kinetic Soundscapes

Software program described in this paper: https://digitalcommons.dartmouth.edu/masters_theses/63/

The motion synthesizer python program is powered by FoxDot, which is in turn runs on SuperCollider.
To get set up with SuperCollider and FoxDot (and Python if you don't already have it), follow [this guide](https://foxdotcode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/installation.html)


To install required dependencies and activate the virtual environment for the python program, run
```
source setup.sh
```

Open SuperCollider and evaluate `FoxDot.start`. Now we can run the program from the command line with
```
python motion_synthesizer.py
```
